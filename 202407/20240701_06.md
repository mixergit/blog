## 背景    
PG 采用32位事务号是目前最被诟病的问题之一, 加之MVCC的特性, 导致它不太适合高并发更新/删除的快速消耗事务号的业务.  因为事务号消耗最多20亿就必须freeze xid才能使之重用, freeze带来的是额外的IO开销, 大量WAL日志, 从库延迟, 缓存失效等问题. 如果freeze遇到高峰期, 很容易产生性能抖动, 对业务造成影响.    
  
[《DB吐槽大会,第2期 - PG 32位xid》](../202108/20210824_01.md)     
  
PG社区对于64位xid讨论了很久, 当前都已经到第54个patch了, 不知道18能不能如期支持.

## 64-bit XID 设计文档解释  
  
归结为2句话:     
- 兼容pg_upgrade, 使用pg_upgrade进行大版本升级可以获得64bit xid的能力.      
- 本质上是把freeze从全局维度降低到了 page/block 维度. 整个集群所有tuple消耗2^31个事务很容易, 但是一个page内的tuple消耗2^31个事务是非常罕见的.     
  
  
1、磁盘表达    
  
利用 heap page 末尾 pd_special 区域的16个字节, 每8个字节用于存储64位的 pd_xid_base和pd_multi_base.    
  
原来的tuple head存储的t_xmin、t_xmax不变, 但是 XMIN, XMAX重新计算如下:   
```  
XMIN = t_xmin + pd_xid_base. 					(1)  
XMAX = t_xmax + pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base.		(2)  
```  
  
2、内存表达  
  
内存除了原始tuple, 同时针对每个tuple额外使用HeapTuple来存储使用以上方法计算好的XMIN, XMAX.  
  
3、page freeze  
  
仅当一个page内的事务号跨度超过`MaxShortTransactionId`时, 会修改`pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base`, 如果通过修改`pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base`还不能使得计算出来的`XMIN/XMAX`不能落在 `(pd_xid_base, pd_xid_base + MaxShortTransactionId)` 范围时, 才需要触发该页面的`freeze`, 理论上跨度是40亿个事务, 对于同一个page内tuple之间的事务跨度来说已经够够的了.    
   
补充: 如果将来确实会使用这个版本的设计, 那么在新增tuple时, 该写入哪个page可能需要有一套配合的优化算法, 因为要避免写进去的tuple版本和page里面已存最老tuple版本的相差年龄大于40亿.   
   
4、pg_upgrade  
  
升级是个有趣的问题, 不过这个设计巧妙的解决了.   
  
当老的heap page没有写满, 也就是末尾 pd_special 区域的16个字节可用时, 这个页面的`pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base` 可用通过当前真实的64bit事务号, 以及升级时的epoch 和frozen xid值(这两个值都是静态的)来进行计算得到.   
  
当老的heap page已写满, 可以把tuple t_xmin拿来使用. 因为升级强制要求正常停库, 所以不存在还没有结束的事务, 并且要求没有未结束的2阶段事务. 所以tuple对所有事务可见, t_xmin就没有意义了, 和t_xmax合起来刚好8字节, 存储真实的64bit xid. 这个过程被称为"double xmax", 反正设计文档这么叫的, 我管他呢.    
  
  
5、pg_upgrade 疯狂模式  
  
为了解决pg_upgrade速度问题, page的升级不需要在升级过程完成, 而是在升级后, 用户读到对应的page时, 完成double xmax或pd_special区域`pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base`的设置.   
  
因此在pg_upgrade升级后, 可能会有短暂的性能下降现象.    
  
  
  
## 64-bit XID设计

+64-bit Transaction ID's (XID)  
+=============================  
+  
+A limited number (N = 2^32) of XID's required to do vacuum freeze to prevent  
+wraparound every N/2 transactions. This causes performance degradation due  
+to the need to read and rewrite all not yet frozen pages tables while being  
+vacuumed. In each wraparound cycle, SLRU buffers are also being cut.  
+  
+With 64-bit XID's wraparound is effectively postponed to a very distant  
+future. Even in highly loaded systems that had 2^32 transactions per day  
+it will take huge 2^31 days before the first enforced "vacuum to prevent  
+wraparound"). Buffers cutting and routine vacuum are not enforced, and DBA  
+can plan them independently at the time with the least system load and least  
+critical for database performance. Also, it can be done less frequently  
+(several times a year vs every several days) on systems with transaction rates  
+similar to those mentioned above.  
+  
+On-disk tuple and page format  
+-----------------------------  
+  
+On-disk tuple format remains unchanged. 32-bit t_xmin and t_xmax store the  
+lower parts of 64-bit XMIN and XMAX values. Each heap page has additional  
+64-bit pd_xid_base and pd_multi_base which are common for all tuples on a page.  
+They are placed into a pd_special area - 16 bytes in the end of a heap page.  
+Actual XMIN/XMAX for a tuple are calculated upon reading a tuple from a page  
+as follows:  
+  
+XMIN = t_xmin + pd_xid_base. 					(1)  
+XMAX = t_xmax + pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base.		(2)  
+  
+"Double XMAX" page format  
+---------------------------------  
+  
+At first read of a heap page after pg_upgrade from 32-bit XID PostgreSQL  
+version pd_special area with a size of 16 bytes should be added to a page.  
+Though a page may not have space for this. Then it can be converted to a  
+temporary format called "double XMAX".  
+  
+All tuples after pg-upgrade doesn't need t_xmin anymore as no older transactions  
+could be running. So we don't need tuple header t_xmin field and we reuse  
+t_xmin to store higher 32 bits of its XMAX.  
+  
+Double XMAX format is only for full pages that don't have 16 bytes for  
+pd_special. So it neither has a place for a single tuple. Insert and HOT update  
+for double XMAX pages is impossible and not supported. We can only read or  
+delete tuples from it.  
+  
+When we are able to prune page double XMAX it will be converted from it to  
+general 64-bit XID page format with all operations on its tuples supported.  
+  
+In-memory tuple format  
+----------------------  
+  
+In-memory tuple representation consists of two parts:  
+- HeapTupleHeader from disk page (contains all heap tuple contents, not only  
+header)  
+- HeapTuple with additional in-memory fields  
+  
+HeapTuple for each tuple in memory stores 64bit XMIN/XMAX. They are  
+precalculated on tuple read from page with (1) and (2).  
+  
+The filling of XMIN and XMAX in HeapTuple is done in the same way as the other  
+fields of HeapTuple struct. It is done in all cases of HeapTuple manipulation.  
+  
+Update/delete with 64-bit XIDs and 32-bit t_xmin/t_xmax  
+--------------------------------------------------------------  
+  
+When we try to delete/update a tuple, we check that XMAX for a page fits (2).  
+I.e. that t_xmax will not be over MaxShortTransactionId relative to  
+pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base of a its page.  
+  
+If the current XID doesn't fit a range  
+(pd_xid_base, pd_xid_base + MaxShortTransactionId) (3):  
+  
+- heap_page_prepare_for_xid() will try to increase pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base on  
+a page and update all t_xmin/t_xmax of the other tuples on the page to  
+correspond new pd_xid_base/pd_multi_base.  
+  
+- If it was impossible, it will try to prune and freeze tuples on a page.  
+  
+- If this is unsuccessful it will throw an error. Normally this is very  
+unlikely but if there is a very old living transaction with an age of around  
+2^32 this can arise. Basically, this is a behavior similar to one during the  
+vacuum to prevent wraparound when XID was 32-bit. DBA should take care and  
+avoid very-long-living transactions with an age close to 2^32. So long-living  
+transactions often they are most likely defunct.  
+  
+Insert with 64-bit XIDs and 32-bit t_xmin/t_xmax  
+------------------------------------------------  
+  
+On insert we check if current XID fits a range (3). Otherwise:  
+  
+- heap_page_prepare_for_xid() will try to increase pd_xid_base for t_xmin will  
+not be over MaxShortTransactionId.  
+  
+- If it is impossible, then it will try to prune and freeze tuples on a page.  
+  
+Known issue: if pd_xid_base could not be shifted to accommodate a tuple being  
+inserted due to a very long-running transaction, we just throw an error. We  
+neither try to insert a tuple into another page nor mark the current page as  
+full. So, in this (unlikely) case we will get regular insert errors on the next  
+tries to insert to the page 'locked' by this very long-running transaction.  
+  
+Upgrade from 32-bit XID versions  
+--------------------------------  
+  
+pg_upgrade doesn't change pages format itself. It is done lazily after.  
+  
+1. At first heap page read, tuples on a page are repacked to free 16 bytes  
+at the end of a page, possibly freeing space from dead tuples.  
+  
+2A. 16 bytes of pd_special is added if there is a place for it  
+  
+2B. Page is converted to "Double XMAX" format if there is no place for  
+pd_special  
+  
+3. If a page is in double XMAX format after its first read, and vacuum (or  
+micro-vacuum at select query) could prune some tuples and free space for  
+pd_special, prune_page will add pd_special and convert page from double XMAX  
+to general 64-bit XID page format.  
+  
+This lazy conversion is called only on pages being read. This can slow down  
+performance after upgrade, but just for a short period of time while "hot"  
+pages are read (and therefore converted to 64-bit format).  
+  
+There is a special case when the first read of a tuple is done in read-only  
+state (in read-only transaction or on replica). This tuples are to be converted  
+"in memory", but not sync "to disk", unless cluster or transaction changed to  
+read-write state (e.g. replica is promoted). In order to support this, we mark  
+"in memory" pages with converted tuples with bit REGBUF_CONVERTED in buffer  
+descriptor. When in read-write state this will trigger full page write xlog  
+record.
