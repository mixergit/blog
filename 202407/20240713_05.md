Use pgstat_kind_infos to read fixed shared statistics  
  
Shared statistics with a fixed number of objects are read from the stats  
file in pgstat_read_statsfile() using members of PgStat_ShmemControl and  
following an order based on their PgStat_Kind value.  
  
Instead of being explicit, this commit changes the stats read to iterate  
over the pgstat_kind_infos array to find the memory locations to read  
into, based on a new shared_ctl_off in PgStat_KindInfo that can be used  
to define the position of this stats kind in shared memory.  This makes  
the read logic simpler, and eases the introduction of future  
improvements aimed at making this area more pluggable for external  
modules.

Use pgstat_kind_infos to write fixed shared statistics  
  
This is similar to 9004abf6206e, but this time for the write part of the  
stats file.  The code is changed so as, rather than referring to  
individual members of PgStat_Snapshot in an order based on their  
PgStat_Kind value, a loop based on pgstat_kind_infos is used to retrieve  
the contents to write from the snapshot structure, for a size of  
PgStat_KindInfo's shared_data_len.  
  
This requires the addition to PgStat_KindInfo of an offset to track the  
location of each fixed-numbered stats in PgStat_Snapshot.  This change  
is useful to make this area of the code more easily pluggable, and  
reduces the knowledge of specific fixed-numbered kinds in pgstat.c.

Hi all,  
  
  
  
While looking at ways to make pg_stat_statements more scalable and  
dynamically manageable (no more PGC_POSTMASTER for the max number of  
entries), which came out as using a dshash, Andres has mentioned me  
off-list (on twitter/X) that we'd better plug in it to the shmem  
pgstats facility, moving the text file that holds the query strings  
into memory (with size restrictions for the query strings, for  
example).  This has challenges on its own (query ID is 8 bytes  
incompatible with the dboid/objid hash key used by pgstats, discard of  
entries when maximum).  Anyway, this won't happen if we don't do one  
of these two things:   
1) Move pg_stat_statements into core, adapting pgstats for its  
requirements.  
2) Make the shmem pgstats pluggable so as it is possible for extensions  
to register their own stats kinds.  
  
  
  
1) may have its advantages, still I am not sure if we want to do that.  
And 2) is actually something that can be used for more things than  
just pg_stat_statements, because people love extensions and  
statistics (spoiler: I do).  The idea is simple: any extension  
defining a custom stats kind would be able to rely on all the in-core  
facilities we use for the existing in-core kinds:  
a) Snapshotting and caching of the stats, via stats_fetch_consistency.  
b) Native handling and persistency of the custom stats data.  
c) Reuse stats after a crash, pointing at this comment in xlog.c:  
     * TODO: With a bit of extra work we could just start with a pgstat file  
     * associated with the checkpoint redo location we're starting from.  
This means that we always remove the stats after a crash.  That's  
something I have a patch for, not for this thread, but the idea is  
that custom stats would also benefit from this property.  
  
  
  
The implementation is based on the following ideas:  
  
  
  
* A structure in shared memory that tracks the IDs of the custom stats  
kinds with their names.  These are incremented starting from  
PGSTAT_KIND_LAST.  
  
  
  
* Processes use a local array cache that keeps tracks of all the  
custom PgStat_KindInfos, indexed by (kind_id - PGSTAT_KIND_LAST).  
  
  
  
* The kind IDs may change across restarts, meaning that any stats data   
associated to a custom kind is stored with the *name* of the custom  
stats kind.  Depending on the discussion happening here, I'd be open  
to use the same concept as custom RMGRs, where custom kind IDs are  
"reserved", fixed in time, and tracked in the Postgres wiki.  It is  
cheaper to store the stats this way, as well, while managing conflicts  
across extensions available in the community ecosystem.  
  
  
  
* Custom stats can be added without shared_preload_libraries,  
loading them from a shmem startup hook with shared_preload_libraries  
is also possible.  
  
  
  
* The shmem pgstats defines two types of statistics: the ones in a  
dshash and what's called a "fixed" type like for archiver, WAL, etc.  
pointing to areas of shared memory.  All the fixed types are linked to   
structures for snapshotting and shmem tracking.  As a matter of  
simplification and because I could not really see a case where I'd  
want to plug in a fixed stats kind, the patch forbids this case.  This  
case could be allowed, but I'd rather refactor the structures of  
pgstat_internal.h so as we don't have traces of the "fixed" stats  
structures in so many areas.  
  
  
  
* Making custom stats data persistent is an interesting problem, and  
there are a couple of approaches I've considered:  
** Allow custom kinds to define callbacks to read and write data from  
a source they'd want, like their own file through a fd.  This has the  
disadvantage to remove the benefit of c) above.  
** Store everything in the existing stats file, adding one type of  
entry like 'S' and 'N' with a "custom" type, where the *name* of the  
custom stats kind is stored instead of its ID computed from shared  
memory.  
A mix of both?  The patch attached has used the second approach.  If  
the process reading/writing the stats does not know about the custom  
stats data, the data is discarded.  
  
  
  
* pgstat.c has a big array called pgstat_kind_infos to define all the  
existing stats kinds.  Perhaps the code should be refactored to use  
this new API?  That would make the code more consistent with what we  
do for resource managers, for one, while moving the KindInfos into  
their own file.  With that in mind, storing the kind ID in KindInfos  
feels intuitive.  
  
  
  
While thinking about a use case to show what these APIs can do, I have  
decided to add statistics to the existing module injection_points  
rather than implement a new test module, gathering data about them and  
have tests that could use this data (like tracking the number of times  
a point is taken).  This is simple enough that it can be used as a  
template, as well.  There is a TAP test checking the data persistence  
across restarts, so I did not mess up this part much, hopefully.  
  
  
  
Please find attached a patch set implementing these ideas:  
- 0001 switches PgStat_Kind from an enum to a uint32, for the internal  
counters.  
- 0002 is some cleanup for the hardcoded S, N and E in pgstat.c.  
- 0003 introduces the backend-side APIs, with the shmem table counter  
and the routine to give code paths a way to register their own stats  
kind (see pgstat_add_kind).  
- 0004 implements an example of how to use these APIs, see  
injection_stats.c in src/test/modules/injection_points/.  
- 0005 adds some docs.  
- 0006 is an idea of how to make this custom stats data persistent.  
  
  
  
This will hopefully spark a discussion, and I was looking for answers  
regarding these questions:  
- Should the pgstat_kind_infos array in pgstat.c be refactored to use  
something similar to pgstat_add_kind?  
- How should the persistence of the custom stats be achieved?  
Callbacks to give custom stats kinds a way to write/read their data,  
push everything into a single file, or support both?  
- Should this do like custom RMGRs and assign to each stats kinds ID  
that are set in stone rather than dynamic ones?  
  
  
  
Thanks for reading.
