## 背景     
PostgreSQL 18 preview - tuplestore.c使用generation.c memory context, 物化节点内存使用率降低,性能提升22%.    
  
One benchmark showed up to a 22% performance increase in a query containing a Materialize node.  
  
实际上消耗内存的节点, 性能都会有提升, 例如sort, group by, agg, windowagg等会用到work_mem的情况.

Improve memory management and performance of tuplestore.c  
  
Here we make tuplestore.c use a generation.c memory context rather than  
allocating tuples into the CurrentMemoryContext, which primarily is the  
ExecutorState or PortalHoldContext memory context.  Not having a  
dedicated context can cause the CurrentMemoryContext context to become  
bloated when pfree'd chunks are not reused by future tuples.  Using  
generation speeds up users of tuplestore.c, such as the Materialize,  
WindowAgg and CTE Scan executor nodes.  The main reason for the speedup is  
due to generation.c being more memory efficient than aset.c memory  
contexts.  Specifically, generation does not round sizes up to the next  
power of 2 value.  This both saves memory, allowing more tuples to fit in  
work_mem, but also makes the memory usage more compact and fit on fewer  
cachelines.  One benchmark showed up to a 22% performance increase in a  
query containing a Materialize node.  Much higher gains are possible if  
the memory reduction prevents tuplestore.c from spilling to disk.  This is  
especially true for WindowAgg nodes where improvements of several thousand  
times are possible if the memory reductions made here prevent tuplestore  
from spilling to disk.  
  
Additionally, a generation.c memory context is much better suited for this  
job as it works well with FIFO palloc/pfree patterns, which is exactly how  
tuplestore.c uses it.  Because of the way generation.c allocates memory,  
tuples consecutively stored in tuplestores are much more likely to be  
stored consecutively in memory.  This allows the CPU's hardware prefetcher  
to work more efficiently as it provides a more predictable pattern to  
allow cachelines for the next tuple to be loaded from RAM in advance of  
them being needed by the executor.  
  
Using a dedicated memory context for storing tuples also allows us to more  
efficiently clean up the memory used by the tuplestore as we can reset or  
delete the context rather than looping over all stored tuples and  
pfree'ing them one by one.  
  
Also, remove a badly placed USEMEM call in readtup_heap().  The tuple  
wasn't being allocated in the Tuplestorestate's context, so no need to  
adjust the memory consumed by the tuplestore there.
