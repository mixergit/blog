## 背景       
PostgreSQL 18窗口查询性能提升优化, 100万个窗口时性能提升40%, 窗口越多性能提升越明显.  代码优化参考如下说明, 看起来就是把tuplestore_clear的返回指针回传了, 减少了重复调用.   
  
类似 `update/delete returning` 减少重复查询?

Optimize WindowAgg's use of tuplestores  
  
When WindowAgg finished one partition of a PARTITION BY, it previously  
would call tuplestore_end() to purge all the stored tuples before again  
calling tuplestore_begin_heap() and carefully setting up all of the  
tuplestore read pointers exactly as required for the given frameOptions.  
Since the frameOptions don't change between partitions, this part does  
not make much sense.  For queries that had very few rows per partition,  
the overhead of this was very large.  
  
It seems much better to create the tuplestore and the read pointers once  
and simply call tuplestore_clear() at the end of each partition.  
tuplestore_clear() moves all of the read pointers back to the start  
position and deletes all the previously stored tuples.  
  
A simple test query with 1 million partitions and 1 tuple per partition  
has been shown to run around 40% faster than without this change.  The  
additional effort seems to have mostly been spent in malloc/free.  
  
Making this work required adding a new bool field to WindowAggState  
which had the unfortunate effect of being the 9th bool field in a group  
resulting in the struct being enlarged.  Here we shuffle the fields  
around a little so that the two bool fields for runcondition relating  
stuff fit into existing padding.  Also, move the "runcondition" field to  
be near those.  This frees up enough space with the other bool fields so  
that the newly added one fits into the padding bytes.  This was done to  
address a very small but apparent performance regression with queries  
containing a large number of rows per partition.
