## 一、分类 Classification   
  
提示(Prompting)技巧   
- 少量学习(示例)：少量学习或上下文学习是指我们在提示中给出一些示例，LLM 可以根据示例演示生成相应的输出。通过少量学习可以提高模型性能，尤其是当任务很困难或我们希望模型以特定方式响应时。  
- 分隔符：分隔符如`###`，`<<< >>>`指定文本不同部分之间的边界。在示例中，`###`用于指示示例，`<<< >>>`用于指示客户询问。  
- 角色扮演：为 LLM 提供一个角色（例如，“您是银行客户服务机器人。”）为模型添加了个人背景，通常会带来更好的性能。  
  
例子  
  
User:   
```  
You are a bank customer service bot. Your task is to assess customer intent and categorize customer inquiry after <<<>>> into one of the following predefined categories:  
  
card arrival  
change pin  
exchange rate  
country support  
cancel transfer  
charge dispute  
  
If the text doesn't fit into any of the above categories, classify it as:  
customer service  
  
You will only respond with the category. Do not include the word "Category". Do not provide explanations or notes.  
  
###  
Here are some examples:  
  
Inquiry: How do I know if I will get my card, or if it is lost? I am concerned about the delivery process and would like to ensure that I will receive my card as expected. Could you please provide information about the tracking process for my card, or confirm if there are any indicators to identify if the card has been lost during delivery?  
Category: card arrival  
Inquiry: I am planning an international trip to Paris and would like to inquire about the current exchange rates for Euros as well as any associated fees for foreign transactions.  
Category: exchange rate  
Inquiry: What countries are getting support? I will be traveling and living abroad for an extended period of time, specifically in France and Germany, and would appreciate any information regarding compatibility and functionality in these regions.  
Category: country support  
Inquiry: Can I get help starting my computer? I am having difficulty starting my computer,and would appreciate your expertise in helping me troubleshoot the issue.  
Category: customer service

## 二、总结 Summarization   
  
提示(Prompting)技巧    
- 分步说明：这种策略的灵感来自思路链提示，它使 LLM 能够使用一系列中间推理步骤来解决复杂任务。当我们将复杂问题分解为更简单、更小的步骤时，解决它们通常更容易，而且我们更容易调试和检查模型行为。在我们的示例中，我们将任务分解为三个步骤：总结、生成有趣的问题、撰写报告。这有助于大语言模型在每个步骤中思考并生成更全面的最终报告。  
    - 是不是有点像写议论文的技巧? : 分解为3个部分 - 观点(结论/理念)、论据(数据/案例)、逻辑推理   ;     
    - [《做决定、决策, 表达观点、汇报时如何支撑你的观点?  - 数据,案例,逻辑,理想理念》](../202104/20210414_04.md)   ;     
- 示例生成：我们可以要求 LLM 通过生成带有步骤和解释的示例来自动指导推理和理解过程。在此示例中，我们要求 LLM 生成三个问题并为每个问题提供详细的 解释(论据(数据/案例)、逻辑推理)。  
- 输出格式：我们可以要求 LLM 以某种格式输出，方法是直接要求“以Markdown格式写一份报告”。

Among all relational operators the most difficult one to process and optimize is the join. The number of possible query plans grows exponentially with the number of joins in the query. Further optimization effort is caused by the support of a variety of join methods (e.g., nested loop, hash join, merge join in PostgreSQL) to process individual joins and a diversity of indexes (e.g., B-tree, hash, GiST and GIN in PostgreSQL) as access paths for relations.  
  
The normal PostgreSQL query optimizer performs a near-exhaustive search over the space of alternative strategies. This algorithm, first introduced in IBM's System R database, produces a near-optimal join order, but can take an enormous amount of time and memory space when the number of joins in the query grows large. This makes the ordinary PostgreSQL query optimizer inappropriate for queries that join a large number of tables.  
  
The Institute of Automatic Control at the University of Mining and Technology, in Freiberg, Germany, encountered some problems when it wanted to use PostgreSQL as the backend for a decision support knowledge based system for the maintenance of an electrical power grid. The DBMS needed to handle large join queries for the inference machine of the knowledge based system. The number of joins in these queries made using the normal query optimizer infeasible.  
  
In the following we describe the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem in a manner that is efficient for queries involving large numbers of joins.

# Essay Summary:  
The essay discusses the challenges and complexities involved in processing and optimizing relational operators, with a focus on joins, within a database system like PostgreSQL. It highlights the difficulty in handling queries with multiple joins due to the exponential growth in possible query plans and the variety of join methods (nested loop, hash join, merge join) and indexes (B-tree, hash, GiST, GIN) available for optimization.  
  
The essay also presents a real-world scenario where a knowledge-based system for electrical power grid maintenance at the University of Mining and Technology in Freiberg, Germany, encountered performance issues when using PostgreSQL's standard query optimizer for handling large join queries. This problem led to the implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving the join ordering problem efficiently.  
  
# Interesting Questions:  
  
Q: How does the number of joins in a query affect the complexity of finding an optimal execution plan?  
  
A: The number of joins in a query grows exponentially with the number of tables involved, leading to a vast space of possible execution plans. This exponential growth makes it difficult for traditional optimization algorithms like those used by PostgreSQL's normal query optimizer, which perform near-exhaustive searches over all alternative strategies.  
  
Q: What are some of the challenges faced when trying to optimize queries involving multiple joins?  
  
A: When dealing with queries that join a large number of tables, several challenges arise. These include finding an optimal join order, selecting the most efficient join method (e.g., nested loop, hash join, merge join), and deciding on the best access paths for each relation involved in the query using various indexes (B-tree, hash, GiST, GIN).  
  
Q: How did the University of Mining and Technology address the problem of handling large join queries efficiently?  
  
A: The University of Mining and Technology implemented a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem more efficiently than PostgreSQL's standard query optimizer. This approach uses principles from evolutionary computation to search for near-optimal execution plans, allowing it to handle large-scale join queries effectively.  
  
# Report:  
  
The essay highlights the challenges faced when optimizing database queries with multiple joins using traditional methods like PostgreSQL's normal query optimizer. As the number of joins grows exponentially, finding an optimal execution plan becomes increasingly difficult due to a vast space of possible strategies.  
  
In addition to the complexity introduced by various join methods (nested loop, hash join, merge join) and indexes (B-tree, hash, GiST, GIN), this issue proved problematic for real-world applications like a knowledge-based system for electrical power grid maintenance at the University of Mining and Technology in Freiberg, Germany. The standard query optimizer's performance dropped significantly when dealing with large-scale join queries required by this application.  
  
To overcome these limitations, researchers at the Institute of Automatic Control implemented a genetic algorithm specifically designed to tackle the join ordering problem more efficiently than traditional approaches. By utilizing principles from evolutionary computation, this alternative optimization strategy allows for effective handling of complex queries involving numerous joins while minimizing computational resources and time spent on finding near-optimal execution plans.  
  
Overall, the essay underscores the importance of exploring advanced optimization techniques like genetic algorithms in addressing challenges related to processing large-scale join queries efficiently within database systems such as PostgreSQL.

Subject: Your Inquiry About Mortgage Rates - Response from Lender Customer Support  
  
Dear Anna,  
  
Thank you for reaching out to us with your question about our mortgage rates. I'm happy to provide the information you requested.  
  
Based on the details provided, our 30-year fixed-rate APR is currently at 6.484%, while the 15-year fixed-rate has an APR of 5.848%.   
  
Comparing these two options, the 15-year fixed-rate offers a lower APR than the 30-year term. This means you would pay less interest over the life of your mortgage if you choose the shorter loan duration.  
  
Keep in mind that while the 15-year option comes with a lower APR and faster payoff, it also requires higher monthly payments compared to the 30-year fixed-rate due to its shorter term. The 30-year term offers more affordability but with higher total interest paid over time.  
  
To help you find the best mortgage solution for your unique situation, I recommend contacting one of our knowledgeable loan officers directly. They can provide personalized guidance tailored specifically to your needs and financial goals.  
  
At Lender Customer Support, we are committed to helping you make informed decisions about financing your home. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please don't hesitate to reach out again.

## 四、结果质量评估 Evaluation  
常见有3种大模型响应结果质量的评估方法.    
  
### 1 引入置信度值 Confidence    
  
提示(Prompting)技巧   
- JSON 输出：为了便于下游任务(如根据置信度Confidence来选择采用JSON中的哪一条结果)，通常首选 JSON 格式输出。我们可以通过将 `response_format` 设置为 `{"type": "json_object"}` 来启用 JSON 模式，并在提示中指定 “您将仅使用包含 `Summary` 和 `Confidence` 键的 JSON 对象进行响应。” 在 JSON 对象中指定这些键有利于LLM响应的清晰度和一致性。  
- 更高的温度：在这个例子中，我们提高温度分数以鼓励模型更具创造力，并生成三个彼此不同的摘要。 更多参数请参考:    
    - [《AI大模型+全文检索+tf-idf+向量数据库+我的文章 系列之8 - 大模型(LLM)常见参数设置, 影响性能和可靠性》](../202407/20240731_02.md)

The normal PostgreSQL query optimizer performs a near-exhaustive search over the space of alternative strategies. This algorithm, first introduced in IBM's System R database, produces a near-optimal join order, but can take an enormous amount of time and memory space when the number of joins in the query grows large. This makes the ordinary PostgreSQL query optimizer inappropriate for queries that join a large number of tables.  
  
The Institute of Automatic Control at the University of Mining and Technology, in Freiberg, Germany, encountered some problems when it wanted to use PostgreSQL as the backend for a decision support knowledge based system for the maintenance of an electrical power grid. The DBMS needed to handle large join queries for the inference machine of the knowledge based system. The number of joins in these queries made using the normal query optimizer infeasible.  
  
In the following we describe the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem in a manner that is efficient for queries involving large numbers of joins.  
```  
  
Assistant:  
```  
Step 1: Three Short Summaries:  
  
Summary 1: The difficulty in processing and optimizing relational operators stems from the challenges of handling complex joins, where an exponential number of possible query plans and diverse methods (e.g., nested loop, hash join) exacerbate optimization difficulties, often rendering traditional PostgreSQL optimizers inadequate.  
  
Summary 2: The Institute of Automatic Control at Freiberg University's endeavor to leverage PostgreSQL as the backbone for a knowledge system managing electrical power grid maintenance led to an encounter with queries' large joins making ordinary optimizers infeasible.   
  
Summary 3: Facing problems with handling complex queries through normal query optimizer due to extensive joins, University of Mining and Technology employed a genetic algorithm for effective join ordering management in PostgreSQL for large scale systems.  
  
  
Step 2: Evaluating Summaries:  
  
Considering the provided summaries based on the given essay:  
  
I would rank Summary 1 as the best among the three. The reasons behind my choice are primarily because it captures the crux of relational operator challenges regarding optimization intricacies in joins, mentioning specifically PostgreSQL scenarios while other two though relevant lacks this contextual explanation that's essential for capturing a comprehensive understanding of problem and context provided by essay text.  
  
Summary 2 despite highlighting an essential context about the Institute's project still lacks the broader issue description, which makes it seem somewhat incomplete or partial if we look solely into the content it has. However, it correctly focuses on the issues posed with the regular PostgreSQL optimizers in this scenario.   
  
Finally, Summary 3 touches upon most elements present in other two but like summary two misses on some level of broader problem context related to challenges faced during relational operators optimization process. Yet, still a decent representation encapsulating problems faced due to high join numbers and introducing Genetic algorithm resolution mention from the text. But somehow seems incomplete if separated from Summary 1 providing background explanation.  
  
Hence, considering overall completeness and context clarity, Summary 1 scores higher. Despite all having relevant points and summarizing main idea it is clear concise with appropriate context thus stands out in quality of expression compared to other summaries. It best represents the main topic discussed about joins complexity, traditional PostgreSQL's struggles highlighted due to excessive use on their knowledge based project which leads them eventually adopting Genetic algorithm solution.  
  
So my conclusion is Summary 1 performs as best representation due its completeness and explanatory capacity providing the essence with additional contextual clarity needed for this essay content.  
```  
  
### 3 使用另一个LLM进行评估    
  
提示(Prompting)技巧   
- LLM 链接：在示例中，我们将两个 LLM 链接成一个序列，其中第一个 LLM 的输出作为第二个 LLM 的输入。链接 LLM 的方法可以根据您的特定用例进行调整。例如，您可以选择以链的形式使用三个 LLM，其中两个 LLM 的输出被汇入第三个 LLM。虽然 LLM 链接提供了灵活性，还要考虑可能会增加成本(因为需要调用多次LLM)。

Here are three short summaries of the provided essay:  
  
1. The most challenging aspect of relational operators is processing and optimizing joins, due to the exponential growth in possible query plans with an increasing number of joins.  
  
2. The standard PostgreSQL query optimizer employs a near-exhaustive search algorithm, originally introduced by IBM's System R database, which while producing near-optimal join orders, becomes time and resource-intensive as the number of joins grows large, making it unsuitable for queries involving numerous tables.  
  
3. The Institute of Automatic Control at the University of Mining and Technology in Freiberg, Germany faced issues when trying to use PostgreSQL as the backend for a decision support knowledge-based system for power grid maintenance due to the need to efficiently handle large join queries.   
  
4. To address this issue, the essay describes the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem in an efficient manner for queries involving large numbers of joins.

Among all relational operators the most difficult one to process and optimize is the join. The number of possible query plans grows exponentially with the number of joins in the query. Further optimization effort is caused by the support of a variety of join methods (e.g., nested loop, hash join, merge join in PostgreSQL) to process individual joins and a diversity of indexes (e.g., B-tree, hash, GiST and GIN in PostgreSQL) as access paths for relations.  
  
The normal PostgreSQL query optimizer performs a near-exhaustive search over the space of alternative strategies. This algorithm, first introduced in IBM's System R database, produces a near-optimal join order, but can take an enormous amount of time and memory space when the number of joins in the query grows large. This makes the ordinary PostgreSQL query optimizer inappropriate for queries that join a large number of tables.  
  
The Institute of Automatic Control at the University of Mining and Technology, in Freiberg, Germany, encountered some problems when it wanted to use PostgreSQL as the backend for a decision support knowledge based system for the maintenance of an electrical power grid. The DBMS needed to handle large join queries for the inference machine of the knowledge based system. The number of joins in these queries made using the normal query optimizer infeasible.  
  
In the following we describe the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem in a manner that is efficient for queries involving large numbers of joins.  
  
# Summaries  
Here are three short summaries of the provided essay:  
  
1. The most challenging aspect of relational operators is processing and optimizing joins, due to the exponential growth in possible query plans with an increasing number of joins.  
  
2. The standard PostgreSQL query optimizer employs a near-exhaustive search algorithm, originally introduced by IBM's System R database, which while producing near-optimal join orders, becomes time and resource-intensive as the number of joins grows large, making it unsuitable for queries involving numerous tables.  
  
3. The Institute of Automatic Control at the University of Mining and Technology in Freiberg, Germany faced issues when trying to use PostgreSQL as the backend for a decision support knowledge-based system for power grid maintenance due to the need to efficiently handle large join queries.   
  
4. To address this issue, the essay describes the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem in an efficient manner for queries involving large numbers of joins.

Assistant:  
```  
After evaluating the three summaries, I believe that Summary 2 is the best.  
  
Reasons:  
1. Clarity: Summary 2 clearly explains the complexity and limitations of the standard PostgreSQL query optimizer, stating that it employs a near-exhaustive search algorithm which becomes time and resource-intensive as the number of joins grows large. This makes the summary easy to understand and provides relevant information from the essay content.  
  
2. Completeness: In addition to discussing the challenges faced by the Institute of Automatic Control in using PostgreSQL for their decision support system, Summary 2 also highlights the need for an efficient solution to handle large join queries. This completeness in addressing both the problem and its potential solution makes this summary more informative than the others.  
  
3. Relevance: Summary 2 directly relates to the main topic of the essay, which is the implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the join ordering problem efficiently. By focusing on the specific issue of processing large numbers of joins, this summary remains closely tied to the overall content and purpose of the essay.  
  
While Summaries 1 and 4 both provide useful information, they are not as comprehensive or directly relevant as Summary 2 in conveying the main points of the essay. Summary 3, although mentioning the specific context of the Institute's problem, does not fully address the broader issue of join optimization and the proposed solution using a genetic algorithm.
