Collect statistics about conflicts in logical replication.  
  
This commit adds columns in view pg_stat_subscription_stats to show the  
number of times a particular conflict type has occurred during the  
application of logical replication changes. The following columns are  
added:  
  
confl_insert_exists:  
        Number of times a row insertion violated a NOT DEFERRABLE unique  
        constraint.  
confl_update_origin_differs:  
        Number of times an update was performed on a row that was  
        previously modified by another origin.  
confl_update_exists:  
        Number of times that the updated value of a row violates a  
        NOT DEFERRABLE unique constraint.  
confl_update_missing:  
        Number of times that the tuple to be updated is missing.  
confl_delete_origin_differs:  
        Number of times a delete was performed on a row that was  
        previously modified by another origin.  
confl_delete_missing:  
        Number of times that the tuple to be deleted is missing.  
  
The update_origin_differs and delete_origin_differs conflicts can be  
detected only when track_commit_timestamp is enabled.
