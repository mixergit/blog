## 背景      
场景应用:   
- 某个程序结束之前, 你不想让计算机休眠、断网. 例如晚上下载资料时、开启了代理的程序时.
- 某应用结束之前, 不希望显示器休眠. 例如看视频时.
   
caffeinate 用法   
```  
caffeinate -h  
usage: caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [-w Process ID] [command arguments...]  
```  
  
man caffeinate     
```  
CAFFEINATE(8)                                                                  System Manager's Manual                                                                 CAFFEINATE(8)  
  
NAME  
     caffeinate – prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility  
  
SYNOPSIS  
     caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [-w pid] [utility arguments...]  
  
DESCRIPTION  
     caffeinate creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior.  If no assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent idle sleep.  If a utility is  
     specified, caffeinate creates the assertions on the utility's behalf, and those assertions will persist for the duration of the utility's execution. Otherwise, caffeinate  
     creates the assertions directly, and those assertions will persist until caffeinate exits.  
  
     Available options:  
  
     -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.  
  
     -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.  
  
     -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.  
  
     -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power.  
  
     -u      Create an assertion to declare that user is active. If the display is off, this option turns the display on and prevents the display from going into idle sleep. If a  
             timeout is not specified with '-t' option, then this assertion is taken with a default of 5 second timeout.  
  
     -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion has to be valid. The assertion is dropped after the specified timeout. Timeout value is not used when  
             an utility is invoked with this command.  
  
     -w      Waits for the process with the specified pid to exit. Once the the process exits, the assertion is also released.  This option is ignored when used with utility  
             option.  
  
EXAMPLE  
     caffeinate -i make  
        caffeinate forks a process, execs "make" in it, and holds an assertion that prevents idle sleep as long as that process is running.

LOCATION  
     /usr/bin/caffeinate  
  
Darwin                                                                            November 9, 2012                                                                            Darwin

系统初始进程为0号进程  
```  
5c1bf480a210:~ digoal$ ps -efw  
  UID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD  
    0     1     0   0 五06下午 ??         3:28.80 /sbin/launchd  
```  
  
打开shell, 执行如下命令, 0号进程是肯定不会退出的, 所以现在锁屏情况下也不会断网了.      
```  
caffeinate -dms -w 0  
```  
  
放后台执行 `nohup caffeinate -dms -w 0 >/dev/null 2>&1 &`
