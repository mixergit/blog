## 背景     
  
- Virtual generated columns, 类似视图, 读时计算, 不消耗存储.  
- stored generated columns, 类似物化视图, 写时计算, 并消耗存储.

Virtual generated columns  
  
This adds a new variant of generated columns that are computed on read  
(like a view, unlike the existing stored generated columns, which are  
computed on write, like a materialized view).  
  
The syntax for the column definition is  
  
    ... GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) VIRTUAL  
  
and VIRTUAL is also optional.  VIRTUAL is the default rather than  
STORED to match various other SQL products.  (The SQL standard makes  
no specification about this, but it also doesn't know about VIRTUAL or  
STORED.)  (Also, virtual views are the default, rather than  
materialized views.)  
  
Virtual generated columns are stored in tuples as null values.  (A  
very early version of this patch had the ambition to not store them at  
all.  But so much stuff breaks or gets confused if you have tuples  
where a column in the middle is completely missing.  This is a  
compromise, and it still saves space over being forced to use stored  
generated columns.  If we ever find a way to improve this, a bit of  
pg_upgrade cleverness could allow for upgrades to a newer scheme.)  
  
The capabilities and restrictions of virtual generated columns are  
mostly the same as for stored generated columns.  In some cases, this  
patch keeps virtual generated columns more restricted than they might  
technically need to be, to keep the two kinds consistent.  Some of  
that could maybe be relaxed later after separate careful  
considerations.  
  
Some functionality that is currently not supported, but could possibly  
be added as incremental features, some easier than others:  
  
- index on or using a virtual column  
- hence also no unique constraints on virtual columns  
- extended statistics on virtual columns  
- foreign-key constraints on virtual columns  
- not-null constraints on virtual columns (check constraints are supported)  
- ALTER TABLE / DROP EXPRESSION  
- virtual column cannot have domain type  
- virtual columns are not supported in logical replication  
  
The tests in generated_virtual.sql have been copied over from  
generated_stored.sql with the keyword replaced.  This way we can make  
sure the behavior is mostly aligned, and the differences can be  
visible.  Some tests for currently not supported features are  
currently commented out.
