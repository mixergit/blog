Add data for WAL in pg_stat_io and backend statistics  
  
This commit adds WAL IO stats to both pg_stat_io view and per-backend IO  
statistics (pg_stat_get_backend_io()).  This change is possible since  
f92c854cf406, as WAL IO is not counted in blocks in some code paths  
where its stats data is measured (like WAL read in xlogreader.c).  
  
IOContext gains IOCONTEXT_INIT and IOObject IOOBJECT_WAL, with the  
following combinations allowed:  
- IOOBJECT_WAL/IOCONTEXT_NORMAL is used to track I/O operations done on  
already-created WAL segments.  
- IOOBJECT_WAL/IOCONTEXT_INIT is used for tracking I/O operations done  
when initializing WAL segments.  
  
The core changes are done in pg_stat_io.c, backend statistics inherit  
them.  Backend statistics and pg_stat_io are now available for the WAL  
writer, the WAL receiver and the WAL summarizer processes.  
  
I/O timing data is controlled by the GUC track_io_timing, like the  
existing data of pg_stat_io for consistency.  The timings related to  
IOOBJECT_WAL show up if the GUC is enabled (disabled by default).  
  
Bump pgstats file version, due to the additions in IOObject and  
IOContext, impacting the amount of data written for the fixed-numbered  
IO stats kind in the pgstats file.
