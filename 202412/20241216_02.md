## 背景       
根据这篇文档, 可以 [《在 macOS 中将文件模拟为块设备》](../202412/20241216_01.md)     
  
初衷是想在macOS中创建多个容器, 挂载macOS模拟的块设备, 用来构建PolarDB 共享存储一写多读环境.    
      
构建好之后, 使用docker device把宿主机块设备映射到容器内.     
  
如下:    
```  
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/polardb_pg/polardb_pg_devel:rocky9      
      
docker run -d -it -P --privileged --cap-add CAP_SYS_ADMIN --device=/dev/disk4:/dev/vdb --name pb1 --shm-size=1g registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/polardb_pg/polardb_pg_devel:rocky9    
```  
  
报错:  
```  
docker: Error response from daemon: error gathering device information while adding custom device "/dev/disk4": no such file or directory.      
```  
   
  
确认了macOS中未对disk4进行格式化, 也未mount到任何目录中, 权限也足够    
```     
U-4G77XXWF-1921:~ digoal$ diskutil list /dev/disk4      
/dev/disk4 (disk image):      
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER      
   0:                                                   +21.5 GB    disk4      
      
sudo chmod 666 /dev/disk4      
sudo chmod 666 /dev/rdisk4      
      
U-4G77XXWF-1921:~ digoal$ ll /dev/disk4      
brw-rw-rw-  1 digoal  staff  0x1000014 Dec 16 09:54 /dev/disk4      
      
U-4G77XXWF-1921:~ digoal$ ll /dev/rdisk4      
crw-rw-rw-  1 digoal  staff  0x1000014 Dec 16 09:54 /dev/rdisk4      
```  
  
  
找到一个类似的问题, 原来Docker在macOS中是通过HyperKit来模拟虚拟环境. 所以容器能访问macOS中的那些块设备, 受限于HyperKit, 不幸的是HyperKit暂时没有支持块设备.  见如下:

## 问题  
I've connected external HDD via USD on macOS, and I'm running Ubuntu's Docker container as:  
```  
docker run -it --device=/dev/disk3 --privileged ubuntu bash  
```  
  
but the device is not present in the container:  
```  
# ls /dev/disk3  
ls: cannot access '/dev/disk3': No such file or directory  
# fdisk -l  
Disk /dev/sda: 59.6 GiB, 63999836160 bytes, 124999680 sectors  
Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type  
/dev/sda1  *     2048 124999679 124997632 59.6G 83 Linux  
```  
  
Here is another attempt:  
```  
$ docker run -it --device=/dev/disk3:/dev/sdb --privileged ubuntu bash  
# ls /dev/sdb*  
ls: cannot access '/dev/sdb*': No such file or directory  
# fdisk -l  
Disk /dev/sda: 59.6 GiB, 63999836160 bytes, 124999680 sectors  
Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type  
/dev/sda1  *     2048 124999679 124997632 59.6G 83 Linux  
```  
  
Here is the device which I'm trying to add to the container (as reported on macOS):  
```  
$ diskutil list /dev/disk3  
/dev/disk3 (external, physical):  
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER

- [How to mount a device of host to host in a Docker container?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/38736319/55075)  
  
However, I cannot mount it on macOS host, as the partition is formatted to Linux file system (ext4) which is not supported. That's why I'm trying to pass through the device to the Linux Docker container, but the device isn't shown.  
  
What am I missing?  
  
## 回复  
      
Docker on macOS runs on top of HyperKit, which is a lightweight hypervisor used by macOS to provide the virtualization environment needed for Docker containers. However, Docker containers on macOS do not have direct access to hardware devices on the host, such as USB devices or block devices like /dev/disk2. This is due to the limitations of HyperKit, which does not natively support device passthrough.  
  
Docker was built for linux, it runs on Mac through HyperkIT, which is a lightweight hypervisor. This means Docker only sees devices connected to the hyperkit hypervisor, rather than the devices connected to the Mac.  
  
Unfortunately, Hyperkit has issues with USB device passthrough from your MacOS to the hypervisor ( read more [here](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/issues/149) ) so the `--device` command won't be much use to you here. You have three options,  
  
Option 1: Mount the ext4 drive to your Mac (not recommended)  
  
Whilst your Mac doesn't natively support ext4, there are ways around [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/210198/mount-ext4-on-el-capitan). I have installed ext4fuse on your Mac by following this tutorial. When you have mounted your device, add it to your ubuntu container with the -v flag,  
```  
docker run -v <Your_volume>:<dest_volume> -it ubuntu bash  
```  
  
Making sure that the directory of your volume has been added to the file sharing folders in Docker.  
  
Option 2: create a docker-machine using the virtualbox driver and add the device to the virtualbox vm (still not recommended)  
  
Follow this great tutorial [here](https://milad.ai/docker/2018/05/06/access-usb-devices-in-container-in-mac.html) which goes through installing a docker machine with a virtualbox driver and mounting the USB stick.  
  
Option 3: Run Docker on linux (recommended!)  
  
I wouldn't recommend using Docker for Mac. It was built for linux and if you don't switch to linux you'll waste your time troubleshooting issues like these for no real reason.  
  
I've got a mac, but run a few ubuntu cores in virtualbox and then install docker on top of them, that way I can play around with docker starm too (which you can't with docker Mac unless you use docker-machine!  
  
如果就要用macOS宿主机, 并且就要让docker使用共享块设备, 一种方法是上面提到的加一层虚拟机(virtualbox or vmware), 或者使用网络块设备, 例如ceph、nbd、或一些开源的分布式块设备项目.
