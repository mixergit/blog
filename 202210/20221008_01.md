## 背景    
解决大表DDL(某些需要rewrite table的DDL)长时间持有排他锁导致业务影响的问题. 支持9.6及以上版本.

pg-online-schema-change (pg-osc) is a tool for making schema changes (any ALTER statements) in Postgres tables with minimal locks, thus helping achieve zero downtime schema changes against production workloads.  
  
pg-osc uses the concept of shadow table to perform schema changes. At a high level, it creates a shadow table that looks structurally the same as the primary table, performs the schema change on the shadow table, copies contents from the primary table to the shadow table and swaps the table names in the end while preserving all changes to the primary table using triggers (via audit table).  
  
pg-osc is inspired by the design and workings of tools like pg_repack and pt-online-schema-change (MySQL). Read more below on how does it work, prominent features, the caveats and examples  
  
Proceed with caution when using this on production like workloads. Best to try on similar setup or staging like environment first. Read on below for some examples and caveats.

pg-online-schema-change help perform

Usage:
  pg-online-schema-change perform -a, --alter-statement=ALTER_STATEMENT -d, --dbname=DBNAME -h, --host=HOST -p, --port=N -s, --schema=SCHEMA -u, --username=USERNAME

Options:
  -a, --alter-statement=ALTER_STATEMENT                                    # The ALTER statement to perform the schema change
  -s, --schema=SCHEMA                                                      # The schema in which the table is
                                                                           # Default: public
  -d, --dbname=DBNAME                                                      # Name of the database
  -h, --host=HOST                                                          # Server host where the Database is located
  -u, --username=USERNAME                                                  # Username for the Database
  -p, --port=N                                                             # Port for the Database
                                                                           # Default: 5432
  -w, [--password=PASSWORD]                                                # DEPRECATED: Password for the Database. Please pass PGPASSWORD environment variable instead.
  -v, [--verbose], [--no-verbose]                                          # Emit logs in debug mode
  -f, [--drop], [--no-drop]                                                # Drop the original table in the end after the swap
  -k, [--kill-backends], [--no-kill-backends]                              # Kill other competing queries/backends when trying to acquire lock for the shadow table creation and swap. It will wait for --wait-time-for-lock duration before killing backends and try upto 3 times.
  -w, [--wait-time-for-lock=N]                                             # Time to wait before killing backends to acquire lock and/or retrying upto 3 times. It will kill backends if --kill-backends is true, otherwise try upto 3 times and exit if it cannot acquire a lock.
                                                                           # Default: 10
  -c, [--copy-statement=COPY_STATEMENT]                                    # Takes a .sql file location where you can provide a custom query to be played (ex: backfills) when pgosc copies data from the primary to the shadow table. More examples in README.
  -b, [--pull-batch-count=N]                                               # Number of rows to be replayed on each iteration after copy. This can be tuned for faster catch up and swap. Best used with delta-count.
                                                                           # Default: 1000
  -e, [--delta-count=N]                                                    # Indicates how many rows should be remaining before a swap should be performed. This can be tuned for faster catch up and swap, especially on highly volume tables. Best used with pull-batch-count.
                                                                           # Default: 20
  -o, [--skip-foreign-key-validation], [--no-skip-foreign-key-validation]  # Skip foreign key validation after swap. You shouldn't need this unless you have a very specific use case, like manually validating foreign key constraints after swap.
