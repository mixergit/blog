## 背景        
当having中的过滤条件满足一定前提(所有可能的分组都会用到这个过滤条件)时, 将其下推到数据获取节点. 提高性能.

Allow pushdown of HAVING clauses with grouping sets  
  
In some cases, we may want to transfer a HAVING clause into WHERE in  
hopes of eliminating tuples before aggregation instead of after.  
  
Previously, we couldn't do this if there were any nonempty grouping  
sets, because we didn't have a way to tell if the HAVING clause  
referenced any columns that were nullable by the grouping sets, and  
moving such a clause into WHERE could potentially change the results.  
  
Now, with expressions marked nullable by grouping sets with the RT  
index of the RTE_GROUP RTE, it is much easier to identify those  
clauses that reference any nullable-by-grouping-sets columns: we just  
need to check if the RT index of the RTE_GROUP RTE is present in the  
clause.  For other HAVING clauses, they can be safely pushed down.

+explain (costs off)  
+select a, b, count(*) from gstest2 group by grouping sets ((a, b), (a)) having a > 1 and b > 1;

+   Group Key: a, b  
+   Group Key: a  
+   Filter: (b > 1)

+         Sort Key: a, b  
+         ->  Seq Scan on gstest2  
+               Filter: (a > 1)   -- 所有分组都会用到a>1这个条件.
