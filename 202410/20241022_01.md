### 文章内容
8.5. Ring Buffer  
   
When reading or writing a huge table, PostgreSQL uses a `ring buffer` instead of the `buffer pool`.  
  
The ring buffer is a small and temporary buffer area. When any of the following conditions is met, a ring buffer is allocated to shared memory:  
  
1、Bulk-reading:  
  
When a relation whose size exceeds one-quarter of the buffer pool size ( `shared_buffers/4` ) is scanned. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.  
  
2、Bulk-writing:  
  
When the SQL commands listed below are executed. In this case, the ring buffer size is 16 MB.  
- `COPY FROM` command.  
- `CREATE TABLE AS` command.  
- `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command.  
- `ALTER TABLE` command.  
  
3、Vacuum-processing:  
  
When an autovacuum performs a vacuum processing. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.  
  
The allocated ring buffer is released immediately after use.  
  
The benefit of the ring buffer is obvious. If a backend process reads a huge table without using a ring buffer, all stored pages in the buffer pool are evicted, which decreases the cache hit ratio. The ring buffer avoids this issue by providing a temporary buffer area for the huge table.  
  
Why the default ring buffer size for bulk-reading and vacuum processing is 256 KB?  
  
Why 256 KB? The answer is explained in the [README](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/storage/buffer/README) located under the buffer manager’s source directory.  
  
For sequential scans, a 256 KB ring is used. That’s small enough to fit in CPU L2 cache, which makes transferring pages from OS cache to shared buffer cache efficient. Even less would often be enough, but the ring must be big enough to accommodate all pages in the scan that are pinned concurrently. (snip)

### 生成回答如下  
#### 回答 1  
The ring buffer in PostgreSQL is used instead of the buffer pool when reading or writing a huge table. Its purpose is to provide a temporary buffer area, which helps avoid evicting all stored pages from the buffer pool and thus maintains a good cache hit ratio.  
  
#### 回答 2  
A ring buffer is allocated to shared memory in PostgreSQL under the following conditions:  
  
1. Bulk-reading: When a relation whose size exceeds one-quarter of the buffer pool size ( `shared_buffers/4` ) is scanned.  
2. Bulk-writing: When any of the SQL commands listed below are executed:  
	* `COPY FROM` command  
	* `CREATE TABLE AS` command  
	* `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command  
	* `ALTER TABLE` command  
3. Vacuum-processing: When an autovacuum performs a vacuum processing.  
  
#### 回答 3  
  
The default size of the ring buffer for bulk-reading and vacuum processing operations in PostgreSQL is 256 KB.  
  
#### 回答 4  
  
The default ring buffer size for bulk-reading and vacuum processing is set to 256 KB because it's small enough to fit in CPU L2 cache, which makes transferring pages from OS cache to shared buffer   
cache efficient. This allows for efficient page transfers during sequential scans.  
  
#### 回答 5  
  
The benefit of using a ring buffer when reading or writing huge tables in PostgreSQL is that it helps maintain a good cache hit ratio by providing a temporary buffer area, thereby avoiding   
eviction of all stored pages from the buffer pool. This ensures efficient data transfer and processing.
